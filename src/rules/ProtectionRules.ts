/**
 * Protection rules guard relationship and list state against impulsive or
 * coerced changes. The relationship rules hook BC's capability checks, which
 * run every dialog frame - so they block silently (the option simply never
 * appears) and cannot trigger/announce without spamming. Each rule also
 * guards the request sender itself (ChatRoomSendOwnership/LovershipRequest),
 * which runs once per click - catching dialogs that were already open and
 * any UI path the capability checks miss.
