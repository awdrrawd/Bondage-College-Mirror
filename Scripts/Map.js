 * @description
 * # Binary-encoded map data
 * This module implements the new way of encoding the map data.
 *
 * At its core lies the concept of a BitString: a stream of tightly-packed
 * numbers with arbitrary bit width. This allows us to store data way more efficiently
 * than using plain JSONs, even if they are packed with LZString.
 *
 * # Compatibility
 * Binary encoding, while efficient, requires a very careful architectural approach to ensure
 * maximum compatibility. Notable, we must ensure that:
 *
 * - Exported map strings from any older game version *always* remain compatible
 *   with the newer game versions. Players losing their old saved maps is an unacceptable
 *   outcome; we must ensure that we recover as much data as possible from those old saves.
 * - Map data synced between the players in a map-enabled room must be readable
 *   by the clients one version older than the current one. This is to ensure
 *   that during the beta period the main branch players could join and play
 *   the rooms created by beta players. This is not as strict of a requirement
 *   as the previous point, but is still important.
 * - Exported map strings from the newer version must be usable by the players
 *   using a game one version older. This ensures that the beta players can share
 *   map strings with non-beta ones, and is the least concern among others, since
 *   beta periods are quite short and *sharing* the map string doesn't happen too often.
 *   Still, it is good to at least make some effort to allow it.
 *
 * Binary encoding makes achieving those requirements non-trivial, because
 * to decode a given BitString the game must know exactly what were the bit widths
 * of the integers encoded into it, and also their meaning. If we just change
 * the code that encodes the map data, then we would no longer able to decode the old data.
 *
 * To solve this issue, we introduce the concept of codec versions. A version
 * is a number that we write into the bit stream before the actual data, which
 * would allow the game to understand which codec was used to encode the data,
 * and call it to decode the data.
 *
 * Whenever we need to sufficiently change the encoding scheme, we copy
 * the latest codec, increase its version and make the required changes.
 * Copying and pasting the code, while usually not advised, would be a better approach
 * in this specific case. This way, we ensure that the old codecs remain "frozen"
 * in time, so no matter how old the map data is, we always have an appropriate codec
 * for it.
 *
 * One issue which may arise in the future is the change in the schemas
 * of the objects we encode. In this case, we would need an additional "migrations" layer
 * which would take the old decoded data and convert it to the one we currently require.
 *
 * Solving the issue of letting the old clients to use the data from beta versions
 * is not that straightforward, and on the most occasions we would require ad-hoc solutions.
 * For example, during the beta period we may use two fields, `Data` and `DataOld`,
 * with the former containing the data encoded with the most recent codec,
 * and the latter having the data encoded with the previous codec.
 * Of course, depending on the nature of the required changes, it may be possible
 * to make a more space-efficient solution.
 *
 * # Future work
 * Currently, we only binary-encode the map effects, to remain in the scope of the original MR.
 * We do this by storing the encoded map effects in the {@link ChatRoomData.MapData.Effects}
 * global value, while {@link ChatRoomData.MapData.Tiles} and {@link ChatRoomData.MapData.Objects}
 * remain unchanged. Thus, we don't need to change much of the existing code, which
 * continues to use those latter fields.
 *
 * In future MRs we hope to unify the encoding of tiles, objects and effects, writing them all
 * into a single BitString. This would allow us to have much greater compression and save
 * a lot of traffic.
 *
 * Later, all map data would be stored in {@link MapManager.Map} global value
 * instead of {@link ChatRoomData.MapData}. This is because we're no longer storing
 * the map data as simple strings which we can trivially serialize and send to the server.
 * Ideally, the outside code would use {@link MapManager} methods to obtain
 * the encoded map data when needed (e.g. sending it to the server, or saving the map data
 * for room recreation, or exporting the room via a room code). Failing that,
 * we can continue the approach used in the initial version of this system: having the decoded
 * map data in {@link MapManager.Map} and maintain the encoded representation
 * of this map in {@link ChatRoomData.MapData}.
 *
 * After that we would have an avenue for encoding additional arbitrary data within each tile
 * while retaining the compact encoding. This, then, would allow us to have any sorts of "tile settings",
 * which would be a great addition to the map rooms in the Club.
 *
 * # Mod compatibility
 * This module is a work in progress and would change significantly in the future.
 * As such, only the minimum amount of public APIs is exposed as of now. Mod authors
 * are advised to not rely on its current behavior if at all possible.
 * We expect to expose more public APIs in the future as the module matures.
 *
 * # General design choices
 * While being public, {@link MapManager.Map} preferably should be only
 * accessed inside this file as it is an implementation detail of this module.
 * If the outside code requires to access something in this module, it's best
 * to provide a separate function in the {@link MapManager} namespace,
 * or a global one.
 *
 * # Codecs general overview
 * ## Version 0
 * The initial codecs version. Only encoding map effects. Only allows for a single
 * map effect per tile (the groundwork for having multiple effects per tile is laid,
 * but the rest of the code is not ready for it).
 *
 * Effects are encoded by their IDs, similar to the original Tiles and Objects encoding.
 * A simple RLE compression is applied to the "flat" effects array, with a small twist:
 * we use larger bit width for storing run-lengths of the blank effect sequences.
 * This allows us to more efficiently encode the typical maps where the most of
 * the tiles would have blank effects.
 *
 * Additionally, we modify the effect IDs in the following way:
 * 1. First, we subtract the lowest used effect ID
 *    ({@link ChatRoomMapViewEffectStartID} in the most cases) from them, getting
 *    what we call "shifted" IDs which begin from zero.
 * 2. Next, we create the list of all used "shifted" IDs and write them in the stream.
 *    The usage of "shifted" IDs ensures this array is very compact no matter what
 *    our {@link ChatRoomMapViewEffectStartID} is.
 * 3. Finally, when writing the effect IDs, we instead use the indexes in the list
 *    from the previous step, and call them the "remapped" IDs.
 *
 * This allows us to write the least possible amount of data per effect ID: for example,
 * if only one effect - besides the blank - is used in a map, then each mention of that ID
 * would only require a single bit of data, no matter what the actual value of this effect is.
 *
 * This scheme results in a sufficiently efficient compression rate in practice.
 * - For maps without effects we will be sending 24 additional bytes (after base64 encoding).
 * - Maps with a few patches of effects require around 0.5-1 bits per tile (after base64 encoding).
 * - Moderately sophisticated maps with a lot of different effects require somewhere around 1.5-3 bits per tile.
 * - In the worst case scenario (a map fully filled with all possible effects without repetitions),
 *   we would require slightly above 5.3 bits per tile after base64 encoding.
