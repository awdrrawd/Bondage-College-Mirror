# BC+ (Bondage Club Plus)

An extension for the web game *Bondage Club*, providing additional features and quality-of-life improvements. BC+ runs standalone or in tandem with [BCX](https://github.com/Jomshir98/bondage-club-extended) when it is installed.

## Installation

**Via FUSAM**: if you use [FUSAM](https://sidiousious.gitlab.io/bc-addon-loader/) (the BC Addon Manager), enable *BC+ (Bondage Club Plus)* in its addon list — no separate install needed.

**With a userscript**:

1. Install a userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Install the BC+ loader userscript:
   - **Stable**: `https://seles84.github.io/bc-plus/bcplusLoader.user.js`
3. Open the club — BC+ loads automatically.

Alternatively, BC+ can be launched per-session via a bookmark (no extension needed) — see the [install page](https://seles84.github.io/bc-plus/) for the bookmarklet.

## Update checks & anonymous usage count

BC+ checks for new releases by fetching a small version manifest at login and periodically afterwards (interval configurable on the General page). The request carries only the BC+ version you are running and the kind of check (login, reconnect or periodic) — **no member number, no account data, nothing identifying**. The endpoint's request count is used as an anonymous "how many people use BC+" figure.

To count *daily and weekly unique* users (instead of raw requests), the counting endpoint additionally records the request's country, coarse browser family (e.g. "firefox"), and two **rotating anonymous hashes** derived from a secret salt, the current date (or ISO week) and the request IP. The hashes cannot be reversed and rotate with their period, so they cannot track anyone across days or weeks — and the IP itself is never stored. No per-user information is kept.

You can switch this off completely with the "Check for updates online" checkbox on the BC+ General page — BC+ then makes no update requests at all (you also stop hearing about new versions).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build      # production bundle -> dist/bcplus.js
npm run build:dev  # development bundle (unminified, sourcemaps)
npm run serve      # watch + serve dist/ on http://localhost:3045
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint       # ESLint
```

For local testing, install `static-dev/bcplusLoader.user.js` in Tampermonkey and run `npm run serve` — the club will load your local build on every refresh.

## Credits

The Pet module is inspired by [MPA (Maya's Petplay Additions)](https://github.com/MayaTheFoxy/MPA) by Maya — a fresh implementation on the BC+ framework, with thanks for the original ideas. BC+'s pet stats also recognize MPA's pet-bowl activities, so pets from both mods can share a scene.
